Let's stop installing, build a virtual environment using venv.

Clarifications:
1. Process ALL JSON files (conversations + messages + comments). Preserve the conversation threading structure in the embeddings.
2. se Haystack's ChromaDocumentStore component.
3. Chunk by grouping multiple messages from the same conversation together. Include metadata (phone numbers, timestamps, conversation IDs) in the searchable content?
4. The command-line interface will have a simple question-answer format for now. The system should be able to identify which phone numbers/conversations are relevant to a query.
5. Use OpenAI's API GPT-4.1, I have added the OPENAI_API_KEY to the .env file.
6. Create a requirements.txt file with the dependencies for the project. Use venv as the virtual environment.

We are building a Python app that shall use Haystack and ChromaDB to build a RAG pipeline. We will take SMS messages from Missive that we use to monitor and interact with our SMS messages from Twilio.

Use the Haystack documentation to make sure we are using the latest version of the library: https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/get_started

There is also a PDF of a O'Reilly Technical Book: "Building RAG with Haystack"

The message threads are in the /2025-05 directory.

I want the chunk the data, add them to the ChromaDB database, and then use the Haystack pipeline to answer questions about the data.

This is phase 1 of the project and the goal is just to ask question from the command line.

Write the minimum amount of code to get the functionality properly working. Use an elegant solution.

Do not write any code until you have 95% confidence that you know what to build, ask me follow up questions until you have that confidence.
